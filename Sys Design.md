# Purpose of the system
- the purpose of this program is to establish a challenge to the user and test his or her ability to either taking a mathematical probability analysis to get the random number generated by the program or for the user to freely guess it and testing their luck to get the out come.
- it serves the purpose to provide a way of passing time and providing an entertaining as well as challenging task to the user
- To be able to give the user a better chance of getting the number correct, it is important that the color code shows and changes correctly in the case if she or he is close to the number or moving further away from it.
- to give an insight on how close or far the user is from the number, the program should give the user the number he or she has tried to input and they can have a better look at how far the number is.
- the program should be able to run on a mobile device and or a computer and should not be limited to one. The website will be compatible with most browsers, this means operation and display.
- Only numbers can be entered in the answer fields during the running of the program. After entering the number, you must submit the task, which will work using the button provided.
- After running the number of tries, the user should receive a feedback on the actual number they were supposed to have guessed .

The weekly breakdown of the project parts is shown in the table below:

#####there should be a table here#########

# Business process model
*The Client asked our team to create a game able to be accessed on the internet.
*We will do the software with the developers for several weeks, with documentation, concluding the necessary contracts, and in the meantime we will continuously communicate with the customer periodically.
*If the software suits both the client and the developers, we will  initially start by getting a beta version then eventually publish it.


# Requirements List
## general requrements :
- The functions of the system can be used by any user.
- Web operation, also available from computers and mobile devices ## chnge this wording

## Surface requirements:

- The website should have a clean and transparent interface
- the user should be able to understand how it operates
- Use color that can indicate or help the user in getting the desired outcome
- Interactive interface for answering questions
- Feedback on the results of the answers, possible solutions

# Functional requirements:

- Users can fill in the the given space with the number they think is correct and get feedback about it.
- Unless there needs to be a change on the range of the number to be generated by the program, all rights to amend this program remain with us and not provided to client  (rights)

# Functional design
## System participants:
  - user
  - developers

## Access rights within the system:
###System Admin(developers) :
    - can access all parts of the program and make changes without any restrictions
    - with amends coming from the client, can change part of the program as requested by client

### User :
    - have no access rights
    - can only provide input information only

# Physical environment
- The program is designed to be accesed on any web platform.
- The website will run on any of the popular web browsers. (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Brave)

# Our developer software:
- Trello
- Github
- CodePen
- draw.io

# Abstract domain model
## Basic operations: 
- comparison of the number entered by user to the number stored randomly generated by program.
- display the numbers given by user in the case the try was not successful

## User interface : 
- Allows the user to select see the results of the comparison and also provides the option of giving a hint to help user.
- Feedback is also displayed on this interface.

# Architectural plan
***HTML displays the tasks and the description of the tasks.
Javascript generates the random number, stores the number generated, also takes in the number entered by user and stores it, keeps all the previouse guessed numbers,
evaluates or does the comparison of the numbers.
